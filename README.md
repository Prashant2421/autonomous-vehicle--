## Introduction
The **Autonomous Vehicle Management System** is a software application designed to manage a fleet of autonomous vehicles. This system provides functionalities for managing vehicles, monitoring their statuses, assigning tasks, and tracking their movements in real-time. Built using Java, this Maven-based project leverages modern programming practices and design patterns.

## Features
- Vehicle registration and management.
- Real-time vehicle tracking.
- Task assignment to vehicles.
- Automated status updates.
- Comprehensive reports and logs.
- User-friendly interface (CLI or GUI).(working later on these functionality).

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Primary programming language.
- **Maven**: Build automation and dependency management.
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: Database for storing vehicle and task data.(we are using mysql).
- **Hibernate/JPA**: ORM for database interactions.
- **Log4j/SLF4J**: Logging framework.
- **JUnit/Mockito**: For unit testing.
- **JavaFX/Swing**: For GUI (optional).

## Prerequisites
1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)** version 11 or higher.
2. **Maven** installed on your system.
3. Database server (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) installed and running.
4. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code.
5. Basic understanding of Java and Maven.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/autonomous-vehicle-management.git
cd autonomous-vehicle-management
```

### Set Up the Database
1. Create a database (e.g., `autonomous_vehicle_db`).
2. Update the database credentials in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/autonomous_vehicle_db
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   ```

### Build the Project
Run the following command to compile and package the project:
```bash
mvn clean install
```
